### Hello there üëã, I am Suchandrim Sarkar
A Mobile developer based out of India. I consider myself a pretty skilled developer specialising in Native Android Development using Kotlin and I  also work on Flutter and React Native.

I also Self publish apps on the Google play store and my two main apps: [Crimson Music Player](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crimson.musicplayer) and [Jade](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crimson.jade) have a combined downloads of close to half a million. I am working on my third app right now.

### ‚ú® Quick Facts

- üíª I‚Äôm currently working as a Technical Lead at [Mutual Mobile](https://mutualmobile.com/)
- üå± I‚Äôm learning Flutter, React Native, Jetpack Compose and expanding my horizons on Android Native Development
- üé≠ Fun Fact: The first app I ever published, [Flumper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dodo.Flumper) was a more complicated clone of Flappy bird, where I wrote the physics engine by myself. May not look like much, but still very proud of it
- üëÄ  I have lost count of the number of unfinished projects I have. I don't mind though, as they were great learning experiences
- üéÆ  I absolutely love Video Games
- üë®‚Äçüíª My friends along with myself established an active programming club in college promoting coding and development which is very active to this day.
- ‚ö° My final year college project was an automatic attendance taking app that made lives of my teachers much easier and is still being used

You can check out my github repos, [Playground Android](https://github.com/suchoX/PlaygroundAndroid) and [Playground ReactNative](https://github.com/suchoX/PlaygroundReactNative) where I try and experiment with Native Android and ReactNative elements and APIs. (Also, makes my github activity look good)
