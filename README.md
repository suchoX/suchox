### Hello there üëã, I am Suchandrim Sarkar
A Full Stack Developer based out of India who loves building, breaking and re-building anything tech.

I write about Tech in my blog [TechItUp](https://techitup.io/) which I have built from scratch using React, Go and MongoDb and has a server/backend driven UI architecture 

I also self publish apps and my two main apps: [Crimson Music Player](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crimson.musicplayer) and [Jade](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crimson.jade) have a combined downloads of close to half a million. I am working on my third app right now.

### ‚ú® Quick Facts

- üíª I‚Äôm currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Myntra](https://www.myntra.com/)
- üñ±Ô∏è Presently, I am working primarily with React, React Native and Go
- üå± I‚Äôm learning Flutter, Kotlin MultiPlatform and Jetpack Compose 
- üé≠ Fun Fact: The first app I ever published, [Flumper](https://apkcombo.com/flumper/com.dodo.Flumper/) was a more complicated clone of Flappy bird, where I wrote the physics engine by myself. May not look like much, but still very proud of it
- üëÄ I have lost count of the number of unfinished projects I have. I don't mind though, as they were great learning experiences
- üéÆ I absolutely love Video Games
- üë®‚Äçüíª My friends along with myself established an active programming club in college promoting coding and development which is very active to this day.
- ‚ö° My final year college project was an automatic attendance taking app that made lives of my teachers much easier and is still being used

I am presently building My own website to talk about tech and anything related to it. Stay Tuned!
